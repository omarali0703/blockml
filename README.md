# MLFlow
1. Non-intrusive framework to run custom scripts in a clear and succinct order

ML flow builder to create and edit ml flows in python. Run custom scripts using simple input/outputs 'blocks' defined in python



## Creating a New Project ðŸš€

> You can create either a blank project or a project with some blocks already pre-generated for specific machine learning flows e.g. tagging, supervised-learning etc.
>
### To create a new project:
>
> ```
> mlflow.py create [project] [project_type]
> ```
>
#### Example: 

>
> ```
> mlflow.py create My_SVM_Classifier blank
> ```



### Adding Custom Block:

> All projects are different, machine learning flows are changing all the time, as such, feel free to delete or add custom blocks in the order of your choosing

#### Example:

> ```
> mlflow.py add [project] [new_block_name]
> ```
